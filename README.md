# 🎛️ soundmachines

A collection of my Arduino-based **music and multimedia projects** — from drum machines to synth experiments, all built to be hackable and playable.  

Each subfolder contains its own sketch (`.ino`), wiring diagram or breadboard layout, and build notes so you can reproduce or remix the project.
