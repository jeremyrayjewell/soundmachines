# 🎛️ soundmachines

A collection of my Arduino-based **music and multimedia projects** — from drum machines to synth experiments, all built to be hackable and playable.  

Each subfolder contains its own sketch (`.ino`), wiring diagram or breadboard layout, and build notes so you can reproduce or remix the project.

## 🎵 Why “Soundmachines”?  
This repo is meant to be a **playground** — a place to build, tweak, and experiment with small musical gadgets. The name nods to classic noise-makers and grooveboxes that turn simple electronics into playable instruments.
