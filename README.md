# 🎛️ soundmachines

A collection of my electronics-based **music and multimedia projects** — from drum machines to synth experiments, all built to be hackable and playable.  

Each subfolder contains its own code, wiring diagram or breadboard layout, and build notes so you can reproduce or remix the project.

## 🎵 Why “Soundmachines”?  
This repo is meant to be a **playground** — a place to build, tweak, and experiment with small musical gadgets. The name nods to classic noise-makers and grooveboxes that turn simple electronics into playable instruments.
